Demo for RPC mechanism that we're going to use to connect Chipa to a Moses
feature function.

It works via named pipes. The client (written in C++) needs an answer from the
server (written in Python). There are two FIFOs (aka "named pipes") in /tmp ,
called client_to_server and server_to_client.

- The server is currently blocked, reading from server_to_client.
- The client needs an answer, so it writes its query into server_to_client
- Then the client blocks until there is input in server_to_client
- Server gets the input, unblocks, and writes its answer to server_to_server
- Server then blocks again until there's another request.
- Client unblocks on getting its answer from server_to_client, continues.

This is pretty general. We assume that we will read and write answers on a
single line of text.
